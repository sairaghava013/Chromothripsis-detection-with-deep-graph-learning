# Chromothripsis-detection-with-deep-graph-learning

**Abstract**

**Motivation:** Chromothripsis, linked to adverse clinical outcomes, holds significant prognostic importance in the context of multiple myeloma. This catastrophic genomic event has been identified as detectable before the progression of multiple myeloma, making chromothripsis detection a valuable tool for risk assessment and early treatment planning in patients with this condition. Despite its critical role, the gold standard approach for identifying chromothripsis involves manual diagnosis using whole-genome sequencing technology, which captures both copy number variation (CNV) and structural variation data. Notably, obtaining CNV data is a more straightforward process compared to the extraction of structural variation data. Consequently, there is a compelling need to develop a chromothripsis detection method that relies exclusively on CNV data, aiming to minimize dependence on human expertise and streamline the data extraction process related to structural variation. This proposed approach seeks to establish a dependable and precise method for chromothripsis detection based on the readily accessible CNV data, facilitating a more efficient and practical application in clinical settings.

**Results:** To address these challenges, we introduce an approach for detecting chromothripsis exclusively utilizing copy number variation (CNV) data. Employing structure learning, we infer the intrinsic relationships within CNV features, constructing a relationship-directed acyclic graph known as the CNV embedding graph or CNV-DAG. Subsequently, we propose a neural network architecture integrating a Graph Transformer, modules for local feature extraction, and non-linear feature interaction. This neural network takes the CNV embedding graph as input to discern the presence of chromothripsis events. A series of ablation experiments, clustering analyses, and feature importance assessments are also conducted to enhance the interpretability of the proposed model by capturing mechanistic insights.
